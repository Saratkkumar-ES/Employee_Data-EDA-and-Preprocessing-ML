# Employee_Data-EDA-and-Preprocessing-ML
EDA and preprocessing project on a real-world dataset involving data cleaning, visualization, encoding, and feature scaling — preparing it for machine learning!

# 🧹 EDA & Data Preprocessing Project

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data preprocessing** on a real-world dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The steps include cleaning, handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- Detailed data exploration and summary
- Null value handling (mean imputation & column dropping)
- Outlier detection and removal
- Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler & MinMaxScaler

---

## 🧠 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 Outcome

By the end of this project, the dataset is:
- Cleaned and consistent
- Encoded and scaled
- Ready for model building and further analysis ✅
